# BrowserCheck
A php tool to detect the current browser and set compatibility levels

fastBrowserCheck is a collection of small tools that will check the browser version and compares it to a list of known compatible versions.

browserCheck employs simmilar but more comprehensive methods to tell the user about their current browser.
It will read from the same list of confirmed compatible browser versions and present the user with download options in the event their browser is unsupported.

You can change the location of browser icons and information about supported browsers in config.ini
